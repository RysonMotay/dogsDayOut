                <p>Hello to all of my fellow dog owners and lovers, my name is Ryson Gurung. I am in a primary school in my last year. During my walks outside, I see a lot of cute dogs everywhere and different types of breeds. I personally want to get a dog myself even though you take walks every day. I love walking dogs and run a business walking all different types of dogs. My parents come with me and we have many lovely walks that we go on.</p>

                <h2>Dog Walking</h2>
                <p>Our dog walks are typically done in limited packs of up to 3 other dogs. 

                    I offer three different walk lengths: 30m, 45m, 60m. 
                    
                    Pricing per walks varies based on a number of factors including frequency and time of day.  Please inquire for a specific quote.
                    
                    I am avaliable after 4pm on week day and all day on weekends, including holidays, and same day requests.
                    
                    Upon signing up, your walker will always be the same, you will have direct contact with said walker, and hear from us directly with a picture update every time your walk is completed. I</p>
